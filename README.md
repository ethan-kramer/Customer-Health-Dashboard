# Customer Health Dashboard

FGCU Senior Project 2022 Sponsored By Testimonial Tree
Team Members:

### Goal: Help Testimonial Tree promptly identify and address genuine issues in real-time
## Description
* Employs a C# backend REST API used to query the company’s database and aggregate data using various analytical techniques. This data is then projected onto a React front-end GUI, which is developed using the Vite framework and incorporates the MUI component library for page layouts and standard components.
* Gives a high-level, summarized view of key user activities, while supporting the ability to view details on an account-by-account level to view statistics that help determine whether a client is healthy, borderline, or at risk for leaving the company.
* Provides a searchable, clickable list of accounts with key figures that determine that account’s health.
* Clicking on an account shows more in-depth statistics and trends of activity including graphs depicting weekly testimonials/surveys sent vs. completed in the past year, average star rating, and total number of testimonials/surveys completed.
